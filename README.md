# ShapeMind

This project involves developing a PyTorch-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model to accurately classify the shapes present in images, utilizing machine learning to identify the shape of an object within a given image.

## Installation

Make sure you have the right version of python3 installed, notably versions that is supported by PyTorch, I'm using `Python 3.9.6` and `pip 23.0.1` for this project.
Then install all libraries needed for the program to run. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash

pip install torch torchvision
pip install scikit-learn 

```
